## Introduction
My name is Emery Ahn, and I am a senior at Chatsworth Charter High School. I live with my mom, dad, and sister, whom I love very much. My hobbies include cooking, exercising, and spending time with my family.
## Favorite Movie
Over the summer, my dad showed me the movie The Peanut Butter Falcon which is about a boy with down syndrome who aspires to become a wrestler. I liked this movie because it was very entertaining and showed that a disability shouldn't hold people back from reaching their dreams.
## Summer Travel Experience
I went to Las Vegas, Nevada with my family where we saw another friend's family, at delicious food, and watched a concert. I ate at the Golden Steer, Estiatorio Milos, Bucchanal Buffet, and more. My favorite dish was the steak, calamari, and banana foster from the Golden Steer.
## Most Memorable Experience
I had a lot of fun at my friend's graduation party because I got to see people I hadn't seen in a while, ate delicious food, rode a pogo stick, and jumped on a trampoline.
## Sports
My mom signed me up to learn golfing at a nearby country club. She wanted me to learn the sport since everyone else in my family golfs. I enjoy golfing when I do it less frequently.
